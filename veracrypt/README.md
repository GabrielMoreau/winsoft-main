# VeraCrypt - Crypt disk

VeraCrypt is a free and open-source utility for on-the-fly encryption (OTFE).
The software can create a virtual encrypted disk that works just like a
regular disk but within a file. It can also encrypt a partition or
(in Windows) the entire storage device with pre-boot authentication.
