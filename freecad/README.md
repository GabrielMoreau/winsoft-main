FreeCAD is a free and open-source general-purpose parametric 3D computer-aided design (CAD)
modeler and a building information modeling (BIM) software application
with finite element method (FEM) support. It is intended for mechanical
engineering product design but also expands to a wider range of uses
around engineering, such as architecture or electrical engineering.
