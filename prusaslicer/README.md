# Prusa Slicer - Slicer and converts 3D models (STL, OBJ, AMF) into G-code instructions for FFF printers

PrusaSlicer is a free and open-source tool that contains everything you
need to export the perfect print files for your 3D printer. 
PrusaSlicer takes 3D models (STL, OBJ, AMF) and converts them into G-code
instructions for FFF printers or PNG layers for mSLA 3D printers. It's
compatible with any modern printer based on the RepRap toolchain, including all
those based on the Marlin, Prusa, Sprinter and Repetier firmware. It also works
with Mach3, LinuxCNC and Machinekit controllers.

PrusaSlicer is based on Slic3r by Alessandro Ranellucci and the RepRap community.
