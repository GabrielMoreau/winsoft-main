# Gwyddion - Data visualization and analysis for SPM

Gwyddion is a modular program for SPM (scanning probe microscopy) data
visualization and analysis. Primarily it is intended for the analysis
of height fields obtained by scanning probe microscopy techniques (AFM,
MFM, STM, SNOM/NSOM) and it supports a lot of SPM data formats.
However, it can be used for general height field and (greyscale) image
processing, for instance for the analysis of profilometry data or
thickness maps from imaging spectrophotometry.
