Your need a key file `aes-kaspersky.key` and a security string
in the file `securestring-kes.txt` to specify the Kaspersky password.
Please note that the "secure string" file contains just
the raw secure string and no other format.
Both of these files can be found in the current folder
or in the `../../winsoft-conf/kaspersky/` folder.

In the LEGI lab, these files are shared between the installation
and uninstallation of Kaspersky Endpoint.
