# VOSviewer - Constructing and visualizing bibliometric networks

VOSviewer is a software tool for constructing and visualizing bibliometric networks.
These networks may for instance include journals, researchers, or individual publications.
They can be constructed based on citation, bibliographic coupling, co-citation, or co-authorship relations.

We launch the `VOSviewer.jar` file with `javaw.exe` so that no window opens.
However, in order to be able to easily kill the process, we create a copy of `javaw.exe` with the name `VOSviewer.exe`.
