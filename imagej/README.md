# ImageJ / Fiji - Image processing program

ImageJ is a Java-based image processing program. ImageJ was designed
with an open architecture that provides extensibility via Java plugins
and recordable macros. Custom acquisition, analysis and processing
plugins can be developed using ImageJ's built-in editor and a Java
compiler. User-written plugins make it possible to solve many image
processing and analysis problems, from three-dimensional live-cell
imaging to radiological image processing, multiple imaging system data
comparisons to automated hematology systems. is a free and open-source
vector graphics editor used to create vector images, primarily in
Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) format.

Fiji is an image processing package—a “batteries-included” distribution
of ImageJ2, bundling a lot of plugins which facilitate scientific
image analysis.
