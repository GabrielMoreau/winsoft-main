# LightBulb - Automatically adjusts screen gamma and color temperature during the day

LightBulb is an application that reduces eyestrain produced by staring
at a computer screen when working late hours. As the day goes on, it
continuously adjusts gamma, transitioning the display color temperature
from cold blue in the afternoon to warm yellow during the night.
