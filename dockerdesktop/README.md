# Docker Desktop - Platform for creating, managing, and deploying containers

Docker Desktop is a platform for creating, managing, and deploying containers with integrated tools and features.

This package needs WSL2 (or Hyper-V) to run.
You need to please install WSL2 on your PC before installing this package.
Docker Desktop's functionality remains consistent on both WSL2 and Hyper-V, without a preference for either architecture.
Hyper-V and WSL2 have their own advantages and disadvantages, depending on your specific set up and your planned use case.
