# Check WithSecure Hotfixes (Action) - Test the deployment of updates

The Check WithSecure Hotfixes is a free and open-source PowerShell script.
It tests whether all WithSecure hotfixes have been applied to the workstation.
It returns 0 in case of success (no error) and 100 + the number of hotfixes
detected in case of error.

The script can be run many times on a workstation,
it's fast and doesn't modify the computer's operation in any way.
