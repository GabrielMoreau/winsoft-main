# Windows11Update - Update Windows 10 or 11 to the last version of Windows 11

The Windows11Update package uses a DOS script to execute the
`Windows11InstallationAssistant.exe` command.
This command installs the latest version of Windows 11 if the workstation
is compatible. The user has no interaction, however, at the end of the
process, the workstation will not be rebooted automatically. 

After the first reboot, Windows 11 will automatically reboot several times.
